This repo shows work I've done for a Modern Computational Statistics course focusing on connecting probability theory and statistics with Bayesian inference, focusing on the data modeling process. 

1. CO2 Emmissions - Used data from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii (CO2 levels measured weekly) to model and predict future levels of CO2 from 2019 to 2058. Project aimed to understand when the CO2 level would be at a level that indicates a greater probability of serious climate change. Using pystan, the model includes the overall trend of rising CO2, the seasonal variation in CO2 levels, and random noise in order to forecast CO2.  https://github.com/smerner/cs146/blob/master/CO2_emissions.ipynb

2. Location Based Assignment -  This project models the cost of groceries in different neighborhoods of Berlin/London, and evaluating whether brand impact or location impact prices.
